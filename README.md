## 🧠 Overview

AI agents on Solana are becoming autonomous participants in the DeFi ecosystem. For these agents to act independently — executing trades, managing liquidity, or interacting with dApps — they need wallets they fully control.

This project implements a **prototype AI agent wallet** that demonstrates autonomous transaction capabilities in a sandboxed Solana Devnet environment. The agent:

- Creates and manages its own wallets programmatically
- Signs and sends transactions without any human input
- Makes real-time decisions based on its balance state
- Exposes a full REST API for external integrations
- Provides a live dashboard to observe all agent actions in real time

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The system has three main layers:

### 1. Wallet Layer
The `WalletManager` class handles all low-level Solana operations:
- Generating new keypairs
- Storing wallet data securely as JSON files
- Checking SOL balances via RPC
- Sending SOL between wallets
- Requesting devnet airdrops

### 2. Agent Layer
The `AIAgent` class is the brain of the system:
- Initializes with its own wallet on startup
- Runs an autonomous decision loop every N seconds
- Evaluates current balance and decides what action to take
- Logs every action with timestamps and transaction signatures

### 3. API + Dashboard Layer
- Express.js REST API exposes all agent capabilities as HTTP endpoints
- React frontend dashboard shows live wallet state, balance, and full action history
- Dashboard auto-refreshes every 10 seconds

### Health Check
```
GET /
Response: { "status": "AI Agent Wallet is running", "timestamp": "..." }
```

### Agent Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | /agent/wallet | Get agent wallet public key and balance |
| GET | /agent/history | Get full list of all agent actions |
| POST | /agent/act | Manually trigger one autonomous decision |
| POST | /agent/start | Start the autonomous loop |
| POST | /agent/stop | Stop the autonomous loop |

### Wallet Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | /wallet/create | Generate a new Solana wallet |
| GET | /wallet/balance/:publicKey | Get SOL balance of any wallet |
| POST | /wallet/send | Send SOL from one wallet to another |
| POST | /wallet/airdrop | Request devnet SOL airdrop |

### Example: Send SOL
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/wallet/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fromPrivateKey": "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
    "toPublicKey": "DESTINATION_ADDRESS",
    "amount": 0.1
  }'
```

### Example: Check Balance
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/wallet/balance/YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY
```

---

## 🧠 Agent Decision Logic

The agent evaluates its balance on every cycle and autonomously decides what to do:
```
IF balance < 0.5 SOL
  → Request airdrop from devnet faucet

ELSE IF balance > 1.5 SOL
  → Create a new sub-wallet
  → Send 0.1 SOL to the sub-wallet autonomously

ELSE
  → Monitor and log current state
```

Every action is recorded with:
- Action type (SEND, AIRDROP, CHECK_BALANCE, CREATE_WALLET)
- Full payload (from, to, amount)
- Timestamp
- Transaction signature (verifiable on Solana Explorer)

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Private key isolation** — Keys are stored in local JSON files, never returned by the API
- **Devnet only** — All transactions happen on Solana Devnet, no real funds at risk
- **Environment variables** — Sensitive config managed via .env file
- **Input validation** — All API endpoints validate inputs before processing
- **Error boundaries** — All async operations wrapped in try/catch to prevent crashes
- **Separation of concerns** — Agent logic completely decoupled from wallet operations
